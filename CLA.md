# The Contributor License Agreement

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) (CNCF) defines
the legal status of the contributed code in two different types of _Contributor License Agreements_
(CLAs), [individual contributors](https://github.com/cncf/cla/blob/master/individual-cla.pdf) and [corporations](https://github.com/cncf/cla/blob/master/corporate-cla.pdf).

FlagAI can only accept original source code from CLA signatories.


It is important to read and understand this legal agreement.

## How do I sign?

After creating your first Pull Request the linux-foundation-easycla bot will respond with information regarding your CLA status along with a link to sign the CLA.

#### 1. Authorize EasyCLA to read some of your GitHub information

Click on the "Please click here to be authorized" link to navigate to the GitHub Authorize Linux Foundation: EasyCLA page. Then click Authorize LF-Engineering to give the Linux Foundation read-only access to list the email addresses associated with your GitHub account.

#### 2. Select from the two types of contributor

After authorizing EasyCLA, you will be redirected to a page to identify which type of contributor you are. 
Select the most appropriate option:
  * Individual Contributor: You are contributing as yourself, and not as part of another organization.
  * Corporate Contributor: You are contributing on behalf of your employer or other organization.

#### 3. Sign the CLA

Once you select the type of contributor, proceed to Sign the CLA and follow the instructions to complete the signing process through DocuSign.

**Ensure your GitHub e-mail address matches e-mail address used to sign CLA**

After you have filled out  the information, Click "Finish" and you will be redirected back to your Pull Request.

#### 4. Look for an email indicating successful signup.

> Hello,

#### 5. Validate your CLA

Once you are redirected back to your GitHub Pull Request, reply with a comment `/easycla` to update the CLA status of your PR.


## Changing your Affiliation

If you've changed employers and still contribute to Kubernetes, your affiliation
needs to be updated. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation uses [gitdm](https://github.com/cncf/gitdm)
to track who is contributing and from where. Create a pull request on the [gitdm](https://github.com/cncf/gitdm)
repository with a change to the corresponding developer affiliation text file.
Your entry should look similar to this:

```
Jorge O. Castro*: jorge!heptio.com, jorge!ubuntu.com, jorge.castro!gmail.com
Heptio
Canonical until 2017-03-31
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems signing the CLA and need further assistance, log a ticket by clicking on the link [please submit a support request ticket](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/theme/portal/4) from the EasyCLA bot's response. Someone from the CNCF will respond to your ticket to help.

Should you have any issues using the LF Support Site, send a message to the
backup e-mail support address <login-issues@jira.linuxfoundation.org>
