{"title": "", "id": "wudao-0-7-10792", "meta": {}, "text": "1、哪些人会出现噪声中聆听困难的情况？各个年龄阶段都会出现噪声中聆听困难的情况，不论儿童、成人，还是老年人。临床上特别容易出现这种情况的人群包括：听神经谱系障碍患者、认知障碍患者、老年人和听力损失者。这就是为什么部分听力损失者选配助听器后，还是会抱怨“在安静环境中听别人讲话没问题，但是在比吵的环境中就听不清楚”，即便他们选配的是很好的助听器。2、什么是比较“吵”的环境？所谓的比较“吵”的环境，是指有背景噪声的环境。背景噪声有很多种，比如空调的嗡嗡声，大马路上的交通噪声，餐馆用餐时的言语噪声等等。总而言之，一切干扰助听器佩戴者正常沟通的声音，都可以称之为背景噪声。助听器应用降噪技术对背景噪声进行处理，降噪技术是当今助听器技术研发的重点和难点之一。3、听力正常者在噪声环境中是否不存在聆听困难？听力正常者也会出现噪声环境下聆听困难的情况，尤其是老年人。日常生活中不难发现，正常听力的老年人在与他人交谈的过程中，经常会出现跟不上交谈节奏，或者需要对方重复的现象。4、是否有提高听力损失者在噪声中聆听能力的方法？两种方案可用于提高听力损失者的交流，一为长期方案，二为短期方案。这两种方案都可以“锻炼”听障者的听力和大脑，帮助提高听力损失者在噪声中的交流能力。5、短期方案有哪些？噪声中聆听困难，往往是因为聆听“辅音”困难，比如z,c,s。相对于元音，辅音有以下3个特点:1)频率大多在4000hz以上;2)声音能量小;3)持续时间短。助听器能够对声音进行分别处理放大，但是对z,c,s等辅音所在的高频区往往补偿不足。短期方案通过利用辅音识别训练软件，帮助听力损失者提高辅音识别能力，从而在短期内改善其在噪声环境中的聆听情况。有研究显示，不论是年轻人还是老年人，经过短期的辅音识别训练，噪声中聆听能力确实有所提高。6、长期方案有哪些？长期方案通常有两种，其中一种是：成为一名“音乐玩家”有科学研究发现，音乐玩家在噪声环境中的聆听能力会好于非音乐玩家。甚至有研究显示，伴有听力损失的音乐玩家在背景噪声中聆听能力好于听力正常的非音乐玩家。原因何在？这是因为相比于日常言语信号，音乐信号对人体大脑的言语处理能力要求更高。此外要强调的是，这里所说的“音乐玩家”是指能够演奏乐器的人，而不只是简单的“音乐爱好者”。要知道，经常听音乐并不能很好地锻炼大脑的言语处理能力，好比“光看体育节目，得不到完美的身材”。还有另一种供参考的长期方案：掌握第二语言。假设你与家人沟通用一种语言，在工作中用另一种语言，并且能够熟练地在这两种语言中来回切换。这种来回切换的过程，其实锻炼的就是大脑的注意力。大脑注意力提高的好处在于，人们在噪声环境下能够只关注某一信号源，忽略其他干扰信号，从而能够在噪声环境中更好地聆听。"}
{"text": "Every year it seems the retail frenzy around Christmas creeps a bit earlier and earlier, and it may be that we have only ourselves to blame.\n\nDespite the loud sighs and eye rolling that usually occurs when shoppers see Christmas decorations in stores parked next to an aisle of Halloween candy, shoppers are taking advantage of the layaway programs, the toy reservation schemes and early discounting as a way to soften the holiday\u2019s blow to the household budget.\n\nNearly four in 10 parents with children under the age of 18 begin their holiday shopping before November, according to a recent study of more than 1,600 subscribers to couponing website RetailMeNot.com.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that holiday shopping is officially in full swing,\u201d said Jill Balis, senior vice president of marketing at WhaleShark Media, the operator of RetailMeNot.com.\n\nThe group has even gone so far as to trademark a term for the phenomenon, \u201cOctoNovemCember,\u201d and it plans to center a new marketing campaign \u2014 complete with a mascot, the Pumpkin-Headed Turkey Claus \u2014 around the idea.\n\nRetailMeNot\u2019s research shows that only 15 percent of consumers wait until after Cyber Monday \u2014 the Monday after Thanksgiving, which now marks the end of the Thanksgiving weekend shopping frenzy \u2014 to begin their shopping. Far more, some 32 percent, said they are done with their holiday shopping by the end of Cyber Monday.\n\nWhile the research suggests that an uncertain economy marked by high unemployment is contributing to the behavior, there may be a good reason to getting going on the holiday shopping before the Black Friday frenzy, which has long been considered the unofficial kick-off of the holiday shopping season. The reason: there may be more savings to be found if you shop before Black Friday.\n\nAccording to the company, shoppers on RetailMeNot.com reported saving more on their purchases on Thanksgiving Day than they did on Black Friday. What\u2019s more, these shoppers spent 5 percent more on an average order on Thanksgiving than they did on Black Friday.\n\nAnd for retailers, there are many reasons to start the push early. This year, several holiday sales forecasts are calling for retail sales to rise between 3 percent and 4 percent. Although that gain is higher than the average annual holiday sales gain over the past 10 years, it is down from last year\u2019s growth rate. (For More:Retail Trade Group Sees Holiday Sales Up 4.1%)\n\nThat means retailers are fighting over fewer consumer dollars, and everyone wants to get the jump on their competitors.\n\nTools like layaway help drive consumers into the stores to make big purchases. Those shoppers also will need to come back to the store to make payments on the item, and ultimately pick up the item. Each time there is a chance to sell them something else.\n\nPlus, those early purchases \u2014 layaway or otherwise \u2014 help focus the shopper on a specific store.\n\n\u201cYou want to capture early share of the market,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. He explains that\u2019s why the retailers have to get the products out on the store floor early, so that shoppers will begin to make mental notes that they saw a certain item at a certain store. (For More:Why Rewards of Layaway Outpace Risks: Sears Exec)\n\nThat\u2019s also probably why some retailers have sweetened the layaway incentive by waiving layaway fees if customers shop before Halloween, as is the case with Toys \u2018R Us.\n\nBut layaway isn\u2019t for everyone, and that\u2019s why other programs are cropping up, including Toys \u2018R Us\u2019 \u201cHot Toy Reservation\u201d program, which allows shopper to reserve any of the 50 toys on its hot toy list by putting down a 20 percent down payment by Halloween.\n\nBut Johnson doesn\u2019t expect either layaway or a reservation program on their own will make or break the holiday season for a retailer.\n\nStill, retailers are reporting that shoppers are responding well to the programs. Wal-Mart told analysts this week at an investor meeting that the company has lined up $400 million in U.S. layaway sales in less than a month. That amount is half of what shoppers put on hold for all of the 2011 holiday season. (For More: US Wal-Mart Stores See Strong Holiday Layaway Sales)\n\nThis year, Wal-Mart began its layaway push in mid-September, a month earlier than it did last year.\n\nThere also is a case to be made for catching consumers when they are in a good mood. Consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose to a five-year high Friday, but consumers can be fickle and there are plenty of potential situations looming that could dampen the mood. Aside from the upcoming election, there is the so-called fiscal cliff \u2014 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's term for what happens if Washington fails to address deficit reduction by the year's end \u2014 and the European debt crisis.

As you know, Radio New Zealand\u2019s funding was frozen in this year\u2019s Budget and we have been forced to implement a range of cost-saving measures to offset an increase in non-discretionary overheads totalling $1.5 million in the current financial year.\n\nUnfortunately the New Zealand Radio Awards carry significant entry costs for Radio New Zealand and the decision to temporarily withdraw has been made to protect expenditure on core services. This decision will be reviewed after the 2010 Budget.\n\nFran O\u2019Sullivan had what I consider a really good idea, during her speech on political blogging yesterday.\n\nPart of the discussion was around the increasing commercial pressures on newspapers, and their diminishing resources to do investigative journalism etc.\n\nFran said she thought it was very unbalances that the Government (taxpayer) funds some media through NZ on Air, but this is restricted to broadcasters only.\n\nShe advocated that NZ on Air should become NZ on Media, and all media should be able to apply for worthy \u201clocal content\u201d projects whether they be TV, radio, print or Internet.\n\nI think that is a concept with some merit. First of all it does make for a more level playing field. But also because a contestable funding pool for print (and Internet) journalism could help turn around the decline in quality research intensive journalism (which is often not commercially viable).\n\nNow as print and Internet has much lower costs than broadcast, I don\u2019t think opening up the field, would lead to a huge amount of money being drained from the broadcasters. Maybe a couple of million out of the tens of millions they grant every year.\n\nNote this is not about increasing the total amount of funding for NZ on Air, but increasing the range of eligible applicants.\n\nSomeone like No Right Turn could (for example) have applied for a grant for his research and series of posts on the sedition laws (which helped lead to the law being unanimously repealed).\n\nA newspaper could apply for a grant of say $25,000 to allow a journalist to spend three months working on a story about (for example) the immigration system.\n\nThere would be some challenges such as editorial independence, but I think it is a proposal worth considering. Why should TV and radio retain exclusive rights to NZOA funding?\n\nIt is worth mentioning that NZ on Air does sort of fund stuff on the Internet \u2013 the very worthy NZ on Screen archive of iconic NZ TV shows. However that is funding Internet storage and access of TV shows, which is different to funding contemporary material regardless of medium.\n\nThe Hansard of the first reading of the VSM bill is now online. If I have the time, I want to respond to all the MPs who spoke out in favour of compulsory membership, but for now will just respond to Jacinda Ardern\u2019s speech, as the version of history painted is now one I or my colleagues remember.\n\nJacinda said:\n\nUnlike the member who is in charge of this bill, I can speak from some experience, having attended a university that looked at voluntary student union membership. I was at Waikato University in the 1990s. I was not a student politician\u2014I want to make that clear\u2014I was a student. I was an observer of what happened, and I voted in the election that eventually led to that university being the first in 70 years, I believe, to go voluntary. I inform members of this House that it was the first university to go back to universal membership, because it learnt that it was a disaster to move to a voluntary system.\n\nNow Jacinda has one thing right. WSU was voluntary, and now is compulsory. But far from VSM being a disaster that students rejected, the return to compulsory membership happened due to the machinations of the then Vice-Chancellor \u2013 former British Labour MP Bryan Gould.\n\nYou see what Jacinda doesn\u2019t tell you is that Waikato students voted to go voluntary in 1996 by 63% to 37% in a referendum . The supporters of compulsion tried to overturn that the following year with another referendum, which VSM also won easily.\n\nUndeterred they tried again in 1999 in a referendum (triggered by the current law) and got thrashed. VSM won 78% of the vote, in a turnout of around 30%.\n\nSo what happened? In 2000 the University, headed by former British Labour MP Bryan Gould, scheduled a further referendum upon receiving a petition late in the year. They scheduled it for a short three day period at the beginning of study week for exams. And they only gave students one days notice of the vote. Their own staff advised against this, and said there should be two weeks notice.\n\nTurnout fell from 30% to around 10%, and compulsion won on its fourth attempt in an election that Iran or Afghanistan would be proud of. I mean at least they get more than one days notice of a vote!\n\nJacinda\u2019s claim that Waikato students rejected VSM, in fact reminds us of how flawed the referendum model is. Apart from the philosophical objections to having 51% being able to force 40% to join something, you can\u2019t get a fair vote on most campuses. Even if your Labour mate the VC doesn\u2019t schedule the vote to favour the forces of compulsion, you generally have the students association having 100 times the resources of those supporting VSM. More on that another day.\n\nAnyway for those who want more info on what really happened at Waikato, a colleague of mine has put together a summary which is below:\n\nOne favourite myth of opponents of voluntary membership concerns the voluntary era at the Waikato Student Union (1998-2000) and the impact of three years of voluntary membership on the association. Labour MP Jacinda Ardern referred to WSU during her speech on the first reading of the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment bill last week. Let\u2019s have a look at her claims.\n\nBut first some history and background.\n\nJacinda claims that Sir Roger\u2019s bill follows previous voluntary membership bills from, in her order, Tony Steel, Donna Awatere-Huata, and then Michael Laws. She has the order wrong. Michael Laws introduced his members\u2019 bill in 1994. It went to select committee in 1995 but lapsed in 1996. The Steel and Awatere-Huata bills were two separate members\u2019 bills that were simultaneously drawn in May 1997. The Awatere-Huata bill did not receive a second reading. The Steel bill was passed in August 1998, but only after a compromise, promoted by some New Zealand First MPs, led to the introduction of referenda as the means to determine whether membership would be compulsory or voluntary.\n\nWSU\u2019s move to voluntary membership happened prior to the passage of the Steel bill. In September 1996, following two years of campaigning by voluntary supporters, WSU members voted 987 to 591 to make membership of WSU voluntary from 1 January 1998. In August 1997 compulsory supporters called another referendum in an attempt to overturn the 1996 decision. This was unsuccessful and students voted to confirm the introduction of voluntary membership. In 1999 there was another referendum, this one triggered by the Steel bill. This time 1984 students voted voluntary, 561 voted compulsory, from a total turnout of 3051. So much for NZUSA\u2019s claim that students don\u2019t want voluntary membership.\n\nVoluntary membership at WSU ended in questionable circumstances. By 2000 WSU had a pro-compulsory president. His executive collected signatures for another referendum but waited until October and the final meeting of the academic year before presenting the petition to council. The referendum was held on 16-18 October. At the time, David Penney, a former president of APSU, the national polytechnic student association and then a university employee, pointed out the problems with the timing of the referendum saying,\n\nthe University will have less than one day to officially notify students of the vote, normal practice two weeks; maximum voter turnout may be undermined by the timing of the vote, which is recommended to take place on the first three days of study week when on-campus numbers are low; the integrity of the process may be undermined given the short lead-in time.\n\nJacinda also claimed that WSU\u2019s return to compulsory membership \u201chappened only after all of the services that (Waikato) students had benefitted from had collapsed.\u201d According to Jacinda the collapsed \u201cservices\u201d were foodbanks, emergency housing and a hardship fund. Trouble is WSU never provided any of these things. Waikato students paid (and still pay) separate levies for health and counseling, student buildings, and food, bars and the recreation centre. The university collected levies for these three areas and none of them were affected by voluntary membership.\n\nWSU owned half a dozen rental properties but these weren\u2019t emergency housing. Prior to 1996 they were, however, rented out at below market rates and often to executive members and their mates. In 1995 WSU attempted to justify the use of student money to buy houses by claiming that if they owned enough properties they could eventually force down Hamilton rental prices. I doubt if WSU members were aware they were funding a Waikato version of a Polish shipyard.\n\nJacinda\u2019s in good company when it comes to making false claims about WSU. In 2000 Steve Maharey complained about the \u201cmillion the voluntary purists at Waikato fiddled away\u201d. However an examination of WSU\u2019s balance sheets shows WSU\u2019s equity during the three voluntary years fell by $4000; from $578,000 (1998) to $574,000 (2000). I hope Steve\u2019s not using the same calculator at Massey.\n\nThe news that Treasury is looking to save 30% of costs and increase productivity in the public sector by centralising back office services may surprise some people. \u2026\n\nWhile the PSA is concerned for the interests of individual staff caught up in the process to centralise these functions, there is sense in bringing back a whole of government approach to much of the states activities, including the back office functions.\n\nAll too often unions are seen as instinctively anti-reform, no matter what its merits, and anti anything that may save money. I\u2019m pleased to see the PSA take a more nuanced position on this issue.\n\nA tsunami is radiating across the South Pacific following a massive 8.3 magnitude earthquake near Samoa and will hit New Zealand later today. \u2026\n\nThe Hawaii center\u2019s updated timings for the arrival of a tsunami in New Zealand are:\n\nEast Cape at 9.44am\n\nGisborne 10am\n\nNorth Cape 10.12 am\n\nNapier 10.40 am\n\nWellington 10.50 am\n\nAuckland (east coast) 11.12 am\n\nAuckland (west) 11.39 am\n\nLyttelton 11.55am\n\nNew Plymouth 12.17pm\n\nNelson 12.23 pm\n\nDunedin 12.31 pm\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management said there was a tsunami risk to New Zealand from the earthquake.\n\nThe ministry has issued a tsunami warning for New Zealand coasts.\n\nMinistry director John Hamilton said that the ministry had alerted the country\u2019s regional Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) groups, police, fire service, Ministry of Health, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and other government agencies.\n\nThe ministry has activated the National Crisis Management Centre and was co-ordinating central government response.\n\nThe CDEM sector was activating its emergency plans.\n\nRegional CDEM groups were working urgently with local authorities, local emergency services and local media to warn and if necessary evacuate coastal areas at risk.\n\nDetailed evacuation advice would come from local authorities and local emergency services.\n\nIf told to evacuate people should, where possible, take a radio and cell phone with them, along with essential items such as glasses, hearing aid and medicines.\n\nTom Pullar-Strecker misses the point, in my opinion, with his column that the Govt should ban using mobiles for satnav. He wrote:\n\nLast week, The Dominion Post asked the Transport Ministry whether it would illegal from November to use mobile phones as satellite navigation aids in cars.\n\nThe initial response from spokesman John Summers was confusing and ambiguous. But pressed for clarification, Mr Summers consulted colleagues and came back with a clear answer:\n\n\u201cYou asked whether a driver can look at a navigation system on a mobile phone even it is securely mounted. The answer is to this is no, not while driving.\n\n\u201cUnder the Road User Amendment Rule 2009, you can use a mobile phone held in a cradle (including those that double as a GPS device) while driving but only to make, receive or terminate a phone call. You cannot use them in any other way such as reading a GPS map, reading email, or consulting an electronic diary.\u201d\n\nI would contend that was a sensible and considered position, and that Transport Minister Steven Joyce\u2019s decision yesterday to cave in from pressure from gadget-fans and amend the rule was a mistake.\n\nI contend it was the exact opposite, and the Minister inserting some common sense into the rule making.\n\nMr Joyce said it was not the intent of the rule to make it illegal for motorists to use the satellite navigation or music functions of their cellphones, \u201cprovided these are mounted in the vehicle and are manipulated infrequently\u201d.\n\nHe met with officials and instructed them to \u201camend the rule accordingly\u201d.\n\nMr Joyce appears to have thereby explicitly sanctioned people taking their eyes off the road and looking at instructions on their mobile phone, and tinkering with it, while their vehicle is in motion.\n\nThat is arguably more dangerous than people using unmounted cellphones to answer calls, the problem the rule change was originally designed to tackle.\n\nWell I\u2019m no fan of the cellphone ban anyway, but there is a big difference between using a device to chat to someone not in the car, and using a device to tell you where to drive.\n\nIf Tom thinks there should be no tinkering in cars, will he support banning all car radios?\n\nHow long does Mr Joyce believe it would be safe for people to take their eyes off the road? Say it takes 2 seconds to absorb the visual information from a smartphone doubling as a SatNav. In that time a car travelling at 50km will travel 27 metres.\n\nThat could be the two seconds during which a child steps out in front of the vehicle.\n\nBut here is where Tom misses the point. The Government has never intended to ban the use of GPS devices in cars. If we did so, we would be the laughing stock of the world as the most common consumer use of GPS is for car navigation. And imagine the impact on tourism as tourists are told they can not use GPS to find their way around \u2013 but instead have to use maps.\n\nIncidentally far more dangerous for a driver to be looking at maps while driving, than a GPS device.\n\nYou see the stupidity of the draft rule is that using your cellphone for GPS navigation would have been illegal, but using a dedicated GPS navigation device would not be illegal. Now it is, and was, daft to differentiate. An iPhone, for example, has just as large a display screen as some dedicated GPS devices.\n\nThis makes as much sense as having a rule saying you can\u2019t use your cellphone to take photos, but you can use a normal camera. Laws and rules should not be based on the technology, but on what it is used for.\n\nI\u2019m a regular visitor to Great Barrier Island and yesterday afternoon booked tickets with Great Barrier Airlines for my next visit.\n\nThen a few hours later, I see on the TV news that GBA had one of its planes crash after takeoff, and I get a degree of nervousness \u2013 especially just a few months after a propeller fell off another GBA plane. Now this may just be \u201cbad luck\u201d as I understand these are the first incidents for many many years \u2013 maybe even decades.\n\nThe 50-year-old was one of four passengers in the Piper Cherokee, which plunged into a swamp at the end of the Claris Airport runaway on Great Barrier Island about 1pm.\n\nThat swamp may have saved lives!\n\nGreat Barrier police officer Kylie Robbins \u2013 who is also an ambulance driver, volunteer firefighter and rescue-boat skipper \u2013 said she and a doctor and nurse from the Aotea Health medical centre waded through the waist-deep waters of the swamp to reach the trapped and injured passenger.\n\nHeh that is very Barrier. The police officer quadruples as the ambulance driver, firefighter and rescue skipper!\n\nShe was taken to the island\u2019s medical centre in Ms Robbins\u2019 four-wheel-drive police car, which doubles as an ambulance.\n\nAnd also leads the Christmas Parade every year!\n\nThe damage to the plane could be seen from the air, he said.\n\n\u201cIt looked like a wing was buried or broken off. The other wing was sticking up.\u201d\n\nThe craft seemed \u201cfairly intact\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are very lucky to have walked away from that. When I called up the hospital, they said [the patients] seemed only moderately injured.\n\nThe planes used are tiny. There is no centre aisle \u2013 you get in over the wings and even short arses like myself have our heads almost touching the roof when seated. Stuff which makes a crash more likely to be fatal.\n\nApart from the swamp, what may have saved them is they were taking off, so fell from a relatively low level.\n\nGreat Barrier Airlines deputy operation manager Mike Maguire said the plane \u201cfailed to sustain a climb after take-off due to unknown causes and descended into a swamp\u201d.\n\nThere is speculation that a very strong wind gust tipped the plane onto its side. If that is correct (and there will be a full TAIC) investigation that concerns me even more than a mechanical failure. You can fix mechanical failures but you can\u2019t fix the wind!\n\nJust going to respond to press releases from Labour and the Greens on electoral finance reform. Now to some degree it is no surprise they disagree with some of the details in the proposal document. But it is useful to put their comments into context and recent history.\n\nThe Government is happy to consult on aspects of electoral law reform that suits it, and won\u2019t look at changes to the donations regime that might disadvantage National, says Labour Electoral Reform Spokesperson David Parker.\n\nFirst of all I must point out the Government in which Mr Parker served did no consultation on electoral law reform prior to introducing legislation. Yep, zero zip.\n\nMr Power has consulted all parties over the issues paper, consulted the public on the issues paper and is now giving both parties and the public an opportunity to give feedback on the proposal paper.\n\nSo the hypocrisy from Mr Parker is immense. It is also wrong.\n\nThe Electoral Finance Reform Proposal issued by Justice Minister Simon Power today shows he is determined to retain the regime governing donations to constituency candidates and political parties even though it became clear at the last election that the rules do not achieve transparency, David Parker said.\n\nMr Parker does not seem to know what a multi-stage consultation process is. That is because Labour never did them.\n\nThe first stage was the issues paper where people could havetheir say on issues, without any idea of the Government\u2019s thinking.\n\nThe second stage is the proposal paper, where the Government says this is what we think should happen, but we want your feedback. In some cases they identify options.\n\nThe Government has said it proposes no change to the donations law, and the public and parties can give feedback on that before they make a final decision. That is consultation \u2013 again Mr Parker may be unfamiliar with the concept.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the current regime on donations doesn\u2019t promote transparency. Labour included the regime in good faith in the Electoral Finance Act 2007, but it failed to achieve its purpose.\n\nThis is worth stressing. The regime Mr Parker is so bitterly complaining about is one his party passed into law less than two years ago. Now how about the claim it has failed to get transparency:\n\n\u201cThis was shown by the low rates of disclosure by both major parties. National disclosed the source of just $130,000 in donations and Labour just $420,000, though both spent more than $2 million each. This is clearly not transparent.\u201d\n\nMr Parker is having 2+2=5. He is like the cop who demands tougher powers to search premises, and upon not finding any drugs there, cites it as proof they must be elsewhere and wants even greater powers.\n\nThe intent of the donations disclosure regime is to identify the source of any donations that could be large enough to be though to purchase influence. Personally I reckon you need $50,000 before you start to get inflluence but the the law for the last 15 years or so has been set at the lower limit of $10,000. I\u2019ve yet to hear a convincing argument to break the privacy of supporters who gives say $1,000 considering that represents 0.02% of a party\u2019s election spending. Even $10,000 is (for a major party) only 0.2% of a party\u2019s election spending.\n\nEven putting aside that argument, how about the complaint that very few donations were declared in 2008. Well there is a very obvious reasons for that. Many donations normally made in election year, were made in 2007 before the increased transparency (which I supported) requirements came in.\n\nIn other words if Mr Parker is patient enough to wait until the next election, he may find a higher level of donations disclosed.\n\nIncidentially I do favour some tightening of the limits. I advocated getting rid of the provision for parties to received up to $240,000 in anonymous donations through the Electoral Commission. Mr Parker does not support getting rid of that, I believe.\n\nI also think a disclosure level over a three year term, not just annually, should also be introduced. But that is a debate for another day.\n\nDavid Parker said Labour strongly believed there should be public comment on potential improvements to the existing disclosure regime.\n\n\u201cBut while the proposal paper seeks submissions on other issues, National has clearly already made up its mind on the donations regime because it suits their purposes.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of areas where I intend to submit against the Government\u2019s proposed option. That is the whole pointof seeking feedback on a proposal paper.\n\nFinally I must point out how Labour responded when there was real proof of inappropriate donations. The Serious Fraud Office revealed that the Foreign and Racing Minister in the Labour-led Government had received tens of thousands of dollars in personal donations (to pay his court costs) from a source in the racing industry which had greatly benefited by the Minister\u2019s advocacy of extra funding for the industry.\n\nWhat did Labour do when the SFO revealed this? They complained bitterly about the actions of the SFO. ANd what did then PM Clark say in response to questions in the house? She said she had not had the time to read the report.\n\nSo in case anyone thinks there is anything remotely sincere about Labour\u2019s position, think again.\n\nMetiria of course voted for the EFA and voted against abolishing it. The Greens never used their power to force Labour to consult on the EFB before it was introduced. Their credibility on these issues is much dented after that.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that New Zealand\u2019s democracy cannot be bought by big business.\n\nFunnily enough if you look at the spending at the last election campaign, there was masses of spending by lots of unions but no spending from any businesses or business groups. The only purchasing of democracy has been from the left.\n\nBut the whole notion of \u201cpurchasing\u201d democracy is bumper slogan politics, rather than rational analysis. The relationship between the amount a party spends and the vote they get is pretty weak. As an example Labour spent more than National last election and got whacked. ACT spent more than the Greens and got under half the vote.\n\n\u201cOne of our key concerns is that National\u2019s proposals will not stop political parties secretly giving money to third parties to run campaigns,\u201d said Mrs Turei.\n\nNow we get the paranoia. First they worry about third parties donating to political parties, but now they are worried about political parties having so much money they will give it away to third parties to spend.\n\nI\u2019ve yet to meet a political party that gives away its money. Do the Greens have any examples of when this has happened?\n\nIf a third party runs expensive ads in a campaign, I am sure the media will ask who is behind that third party, and where did the money come from. And if the third party refuses to say, well the public are pretty good with this stuff, and will tend to punish those involved.\n\nIn the 2005 election, the Exclusive Brethren ran a secret $1 million dollar campaign against the Green Party.\n\nFrom their own money. Or is Metiria saying she thinks National were secretly funding the Exclusive Brethren?\n\n\u201cAnother problem is that donations to political parties under $10,000 can be kept secret \u2013 the public has a right to know who is giving their MPs money.\n\nYes, but at what level. As I said $10,000 is 0.2% of an election campaign for a major party and maybe 0.5% for a minor party. Are the Greens saying you can get \u201cfavours\u201d for such a small amount?\n\nThe Greens of course have an agenda. They find raising money a hassle, as do all parties. They think taxpayers should be forced to fund their political party. And the best way of doing that is setting the disclosure threshold for donations so low, that fewer people donate voluntarily so they can force everyone to donate to them compulsorily through their taxes.\n\n\u201cWe are also concerned about the proposal to allow anyone to run electoral ads on TV and radio, as this would lead to the airways being saturated in electoral ads paid for by wealthy special interest groups,\u201d said Mrs Turei.\n\nConsider what they are really saying here. They are saying that in an election campaign, they do not want anyone who wants to criticise a party, to be able to do so through a broadcast medium. They are saying that only political parties should be able to have their voices heard on broadcast medium. Even worse they are saying that only political parties funded by the taxpayer can have their voice heard, while individuals or organisation who want to use their own funds, are banned from the airwaves.\n\nSuch defenders of free speech.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to end up like the US where negative campaign ads paid for by big business dominate the airways.\u201d\n\nIronically almost everything the Greens propose takes us closer to the US system of political finance. It is the limit on donations to parties and candidates that has shifted the spending to the lobby groups.\n\nOh and their constant bogeyman of big business is tiresome. Again in NZ there were no business funded election ads, but plenty of union ones. And in the US last election the left massively outspent the right.\n\nAgain it would be nice to see some sensible analysis rather than slogans.\n\nThe Government\u2019s proposals do not include the option of a fixed election date.\n\nA fixed date would provide certainty for the public and political parties, said Mrs Turei, there is no good reason not to have one. The only reason not to fix the election date was to give an advantage to the Government of the day.\n\nNow I agree with Metiria that there should be a fixed election date. But to be fair to the Govt, this is a consultation on finance issues, not wider electoral issues. A change to a fixed election date is a fairly major constitutional issue. It is one I support but probably needs its own workstream.\n\nPetitions from leading film directors and other cinema figures, including one signed by the celebrated Polish director, Andrzej Wajda, focused most of their anger on the Swiss authorities. The fact that the Polish-born Mr Polanski was arrested as he arrived to receive a lifetime achievement award at the Zurich film festival was, they said, \u201ca provocation\u201d.\n\nNo a provocation is the fact he allegedly raped a 13 year old girl, and fled the country.\n\nA leading French director, Bertrand Tavernier, said: \u201cThe Swiss are extraordinary. Here is a law which is supposed to combat drug-trafficking and tax evasion and the first victim they pick on is an artist.\u201d\n\nOh how dare they pick on an artist. The shame, the shame. Artists are all good noble people.\n\nHe did not get arrested because he is an artist. He got arrested because he is an (alleged) child rapist.\n\nThe Swiss Economy Minister, Doris Leuthard, rejected suggestions that the arrest was intended to ease strained relations between Switzerland and the US. An extradition treaty between Washington and Berne obliged Switzerland to act, without question, on any arrest warrant issued by the US authorities, she said. The international outcry on Mr Polanski\u2019s behalf implied that there should be a law for ordinary people and another for celebrated film directors, she suggested.\n\nThat is precisely what they are saying it seems.\n\nIn a radio interview, the French Foreign Minister, Mr Kouchner, said that the Californian and Swiss authorities had acted unreasonably. \u201cIt\u2019s a little sinister, this business, to be quite frank,\u201d Mr Kouchner said. \u201cA man of such talent, recognised throughout the world \u2026 All this is not nice.\u201d\n\nBeing arrested for rape is not nice I agree. Being raped as a 13 year old is even worse I would say. The only sinister aspect is that France has sheltered him for so long.\n\nThe jury of the Zurich film festival \u2026 accused the Swiss government of \u201cphilistine collusion\u201d with the US.\n\nOh yes those cultural philistines. How dare they arrest a movie director for child rape. Don\u2019t those philistines know it is okay if you are an artist.\n\nThe jury\u2019s president, the American actress Debra Winger, said: \u201c[The arrest] is based on a three-decade-old case that is all but dead but for minor technicalities.\u201d\n\nSo if you flee overseas, then the case should be dropped if you do it for long enough.\n\nWhen news of his arrest first came through I was thinking hey maybe they should not send him to jail. But the more the cultural elite complain about what has happened, the harsher I think the sentence should be.\n\nFran O\u2019Sullivan addressed several dozen people at breakfast this morning on the topic of the Accidental Empire of Political Blogging. Rural Women NZ hosted the breakfast.\n\nFran was mainly positive about the impact political blogging has had in NZ, saying the diversity is useful, as is the competition for the media to some degree.\n\nShe did have some criticisms, such as accuracy and fact checking, and most of all political bloggers who blog anonymously. Her big call was for more political bloggers to post under their names so there is some accountability for what they say \u2013 as journalists have.\n\nShe was full of praise for Red Alert and said it has obviously replaced The Standard as the most influential and useful blog on the left.\n\nWhale Oil got a mention with praise for his willingness to savage members of his own party (she joked that his father must be glad he has a life membership that can\u2019t be revoked) but said she thought the pre-election scuttlebutt on Damien O\u2019Connor was a serious error of judgement.\n\nLots of questions and discussion ranging from has a blogger been sued yet, to press gallery membership. Fran nicely refers to the gallery as a cartel\n\nWas a very good breakfast and even better drinks afterwards, finally escaping around 10.30 am!\n\nSue Bradford announced last week that she is leaving Parliament, citing disappointment at losing the co-leadership contest. It\u2019s an honest statement and she is to be admired for that. She did not add that she is unhappy at the direction the Green Party is headed, but there is no doubt that she would have steered a very different course from that intended by the current leadership. Perhaps she saw little place for herself in the new, unaligned, Green Party.\n\nNandor makes clear there must be considerable tension over direction and leadership.\n\nSue was a sometimes controversial figure, but there is no doubt that she has played a key role in the early development of the Parliamentary Greens. She has also played an important role in Parliament, but that is all about to change. Despite her brave face, life after Parliament will be hard to adjust to. Once gone, she is unlikely to get any support from the Greens during this difficult transition, and I hope that her personal support system is strong. She will need it.\n\nOuch. To be fair almost all former MPs find it pretty hard after Parliament.\n\nThe Old Left element of the party, once so influential, will be scarcely represented once Sue has left. Keith Locke, considered by many to be the archetypical communist, is actually nothing of the sort. While he is the oldest member of the Green caucus, his mental youthfulness and his sense of empathy have prevented him from becoming sufficiently doctrinaire. With this new influx, the Green Party is likely to become a more emphatically \u2018green-wing\u2019 party than has been possible in the past.\n\nThe Kaka should be the Native Bird of the Year. The kaka was named after the sounds it makes as an alarm. It is our native mountain parrot and is the best New Zealand traditions is a loud, noisy and dexterous bird.\n\nAs most New Zealanders are, the Kaka is a gregarious and social bird. They like to hang out in groups, and will even rail around a wounded comrade \u2013 often putting themselves at great risk.\n\nLong before the first bungy jump was constructed at Skippers Canyon, the Kaka had its own version. You\u2019ll see them slowly ascend and then suddenly close their wings and plummet downwards, pulling up just in time.\n\nKaka also make great parents. You\u2019ll never see a Kaka investigated by CYFS.\nThey have sadly often been found dead at the entrance of their nesting hole after a forest fire. They refuse to abandon their offspring.\n\nSo for their noisiness, their supporting wounded colleagues, their bungy jumping and their willingness to die for their kids, I say make the Kaka the New Zealand Native Bird of the Year.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been a shareholder in Xero from its initial float (and before they had any customers!) but only been using it in my own business for six months or so.\n\nWe were using MYOB and as I had paid for that software, I was a bit resistant to going to a monthly subscription but my business manager, Anna, actually convinced me of the benefits after she had used it elsewhere. So we went ahead and subscribed at $49/month.\n\nI can\u2019t describe how great it has been. The synchronization with online banking has saved hours of time, but most of all I can just login to Xero from anywhere in the world and see what bills have been paid or need authorisation, what invoices are going out to our clients etc, and most of all our profitability.\n\nXero have announced to the share market yesterday, and are advertising the changes \u2013 a new pricing model. Currently it is $49 a month for everyone, but now there are three options:\n\n$29/mth \u2013 ideal for contractors and freelancers with a small number of transactions\n\n$49/mth suited to most business\n\n$64/mth for businesses that need multi- currency conversion\n\nXero is keen on feedback from readers, especially those who are freelancers, contractors or in a small business, about how you currently do your accounts (do you just use spreadsheets), what features you most want, is the new price level attractive and is the transaction limit okay?\n\nI think it is wonderful that Labour rewarded their (former) major donor by letting him help choose New Zealand\u2019s Governor-General.\n\nThe Herald reports:\n\nSir Howard Morrison was in line to become Governor General of New Zealand, according to billionaire Owen Glenn. \u2026\n\nHe said Sir Howard\u2019s name was on a short list of six when the new Governor General was being chosen.\n\n\u201cWhen the Labour Party was still talking to me, I actually pushed to have Sir Howard on the Governor General list,\u201d Mr Glenn told the crowded marae.\n\nHe said both parties \u2013 Labour and National \u2013 chose the Governor General.\n\n\u201cHe would have been Governor General but for one person.\n\nSo Owen Glenn was in the loop enough that he knew how many were on the short list, and who was blocking Sir Howard\u2019s name going forward. No wonder he kept donating money with such inside access. No wonder he thought he would be made Consul to Monaco.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Murray McCully has been accused of acting vindictively towards overseas aid agencies which criticised his changes to the direction of the aid programme earlier this year.\n\nLabour\u2019s associate foreign affairs spokesman, Phil Twyford, said funding had been cut to the Council for International Development (CID), an umbrella organisation of aid groups, by $650,000 over the next two years.\n\nHowever, Mr McCully\u2019s spokesman said Mr Twyford was not correct. No final decisions about the funding had been taken and the figures quoted were indicative at this stage.\n\nI\u2019d ask why the Government is funding the CID at all? Shouldn\u2019t it be funded by its 94 members?\n\nOne would think that Labour would support spending overseas aid money on well overseas aid, rather than lobby groups in Wellington.\n\nMr Twyford said he expected the minister to say that he wanted to spend the money overseas instead of in New Zealand.\n\n\u201cThe funding of CID is a tiny fraction of the $32 million NZAID spends each year on aid delivered by NGOs.\n\n\u201cIt builds the professional and administrative capacity of the NGOs so they can be more accountable for taxpayer funds.\u201d\n\nThe cuts threatened to undermine the NGOs\u2019 efforts to be more effective and accountable, Mr Twyford said.\n\nDon\u2019t you love the double speak here. Twyford (the parliamentary spokesperson for aid NGOs) claims that the taxpayer has to pour money into the CID so that NGOs are more effective. In my experience the removal of taxpayer subsidies is what causes NGOs to be more efficient.", "meta": {}}

{"text": "EU in drive to make Brussels more political\n\nThe European Commission next month is to announce plans to establish European political foundations to spice up the tone of political discourse at the EU level and entice voters to ballot boxes after a series of poor turnouts at the European elections.\n\nAccording to an EU official closely involved in the proposal, the idea is to give European parties such as the European People's Party, the European socialists or the European liberals greater ability \"to develop networks on European issues.\"\n\nThese foundations - which would be ideologically linked to a political party - would contribute to a European political culture by \"observing, analysing and contributing to the debate on European public policy issues and the process of European integration.\"\n\nThey would also support \"European seminars\" and serve as a \"framework for national think tanks, political foundations and academics to work together at [the] European level,\" says a preliminary paper on the issue, seen by EUobserver.\n\nProper European debate\n\nAt the moment, European parties - there are currently ten - occupy an undefined public space. They are trans-European but lack the link to citizens as national parties are affiliated rather than individual members.\n\nOn top of this, they have difficulty making EU political campaigns, hampered by language barriers and different political traditions in the 27 member states.\n\nThe move to up their profile is the brainchild of EU communications commissioner Margot Wallstrom who wants to introduce a \"proper European debate,\" with the current European political discussion seen as taking place in a \"Brussels bubble\" dominated by political elites.\n\nAs yet, it is unclear how much money will go towards the scheme - EU officials have previously spoken of \u20ac1 million - but 15 percent of the money will be divided equally between all of the foundations while the remaining 85 percent will be distributed according to how many MEPs a party has.\n\nThe commission is also to leave the touchy question of setting out criteria for foundations entitled to receive the money up to the parliament saying only that they should respect fundamental European values.\n\nThe June proposal is part of the updating of an EU law on funding EU political parties - this law currently states that the parties have to observe the principles upon which the European Union is founded as well as be represented in at least one quarter of member states.\n\nAlthough political foundations are well established in Germany, where the major parties have ideologically associated foundations - Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, CDU or Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, SPD - and there is a budget line for them in the German parliament, they are not common elsewhere.\n\nControversy\n\nMs Wallstrom, who recently said the EU could do with a bit of \"diversity\" and \"controversy\" to make it register more with citizens, took charge of the communications portfolio in 2004 - a year that saw record low turnouts in the European elections in central and eastern European member states who had only just joined the bloc.\n\nThree years on little has changed. European elections last week in Bulgaria, a member of the EU since January, saw a turnout of just 29 percent.\n\nThe commission is trying to bring about a visible difference in the next European election in mid-2009. This is the time by which most EU leaders want to have agreed a new EU treaty for the bloc - one likely to give much more co-legislation powers to MEPs.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission is also planning on publishing a separate proposal next month on how better to communicate with citizens.\n\nThe paper is likely to contain proposals to give EU officials more leeway to talk to the media and extend the scope of Brussels' audiovisual services.", "meta": {}}

That is earlier than the\ncompany had previously indicated.\n\nEwin said the proposed transcontinental pipe would open\nAustralia's domestic market for northern producers. The system\nwould carry natural gas from the Northern Territory to Moomba in\nSouth Australia, the hub for gas to the country's main\nsoutheastern markets. Australia's government said last month it\nwould study and possibly contribute to building the pipeline.\n\nThat offers another opportunity for developing gas resources\nin a region where Royal Dutch Shell, Malaysia's\nPetronas, Italy's ENI SpA, and Australia's\nSantos and Origin Energy have undeveloped\ninterests.\n\n\"Really our only route to market at the moment is LNG\n(liquefied natural gas) for northern Australia gas, and we\nalways welcome anything that opens up another route to market,\"\nEwin said.\n\n\"We'd definitely look in to it ... southeast Australia for\nLNG has historically been and will be in future a big market for\nus. Proximity to market just means there is a cost advantage in\nterms of competing.\"\n\nA looming gas shortage for Australia's populous east has\nseen prices spike and the government search for solutions,\nincluding calling a crisis meeting this week with producers,\nsome of whom have drawn gas from the domestic market to meet\nexport contracts.\n\nAnother pipeline linking central Australia with the east is\ndelayed.\n\nConocoPhillips announced on Wednesday it is also considering\nadding a second production unit, or train, at its Darwin LNG\nplant and possibly processing gas from rivals' undeveloped\nfields.\n\nConocoPhilips is also in the final stages of picking a new\ngas field to fill the plant's existing train, when supply from\nits current gas source, the Bayu-Undan field, runs out around\n2022.\n\n\"Barossa looks to be the lowest cost development,\" Ewin\nsaid, adding its proximity and the ease of extraction means the\ncompany is leaning toward preferring it over the larger Poseidon\nfield.\n\nThe project is expected to cost up to A$10 billion ($7.5\nbillion).\n\nThe company had said in February a final decision was due\nlate in 2018 at the earliest.", "meta": {}}
